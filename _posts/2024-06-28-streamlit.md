The [streamlit cheatsheet](https://dmishra86.github.io/streamlit-cheatsheet/) is a concise, easy-to-use guide to help developers and data scientists quickly get up to speed with building interactive web applications. Unlike the more extensive official documentation, this cheatsheet distills the essentials into a handy reference that makes it easier to find the information you need, when you need it.

This is not a comprehensive guide. For a detailed understanding and the latest updates, always refer to the [official Streamlit documentation](https://docs.streamlit.io/)
